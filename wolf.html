        <p>As the most endangered wolf species, the Red Wolf can be found in forests, swamps, or coastal prairies<br>only within North Carolina.
        They are social mammals that form packs of five to eight wolves. Less than half of<br>the pups that are born in the wild grow to 
        adulthood as a result of disease, malnutrition, and predation.<br>The existence of Red Wolves is threatened by hunting, habitat loss
        and<br>fragmentation, hybridization, and competition with coyotes.</p>
